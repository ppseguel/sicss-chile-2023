The event was organized by five organizers (Andr&eacute;s Abeliuk, Hern&aacute;n Sarmiento, Pedro Seguel, Pablo Beyt&iacute;a, and Juan Reutter). With four Teaching Assistants (Sebast&iacute;an Ferrada, Jorge Ortiz, Gabriel Iturra, and Cinthia S&aacute;nchez). We hold all sessions in-person with 20 participants for two weeks.</span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c1">Applications and Outreach</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c10">We received applications from 62 eager candidates, from which 20 were selected. The selection process entailed each member of our five-person organizing team nominating 10 candidates based on the strength of their applications. After creating this preliminary list, we engaged in a comprehensive discussion to finalize our selections, ensuring we maintained gender and disciplinary diversity.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c10">Upon finalizing our selection, we extended invitations to the chosen candidates, seeking their confirmation to participate in the nine-day SICSS event. If any selected individual was unable to commit, we proceeded to invite the next deserving candidate from our list.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c10">Feedback from participants revealed diverse channels through which they discovered the event. Notably, many cited LinkedIn posts by organizers and associated organizations. Others were informed by their supervisors, discovered the event on the SICSS website&#39;s location pages, or heard about it through individuals affiliated with our partner organizations.</span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c1">Onboarding</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">To ensure participants were well-prepared, those who confirmed their attendance were provided with several resource recommendations:</span></p><ol class="c12 lst-kix_list_3-0 start" start="1"><li class="c6 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7 c4">The book &ldquo;Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age&rdquo; by Matt Salganik was listed as a primary read.</span></li><li class="c6 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7 c4">We recommended the standard SICSS boot camp videos.</span></li><li class="c6 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7 c4">A special SICSS-Chile was announced, which would be made available a week before the Institute&#39;s commencement.</span></li><li class="c6 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">In alignment with our decision to primarily use Python and Collab for our software tools, we suggested participants undertake the course &#39;</span><span class="c21"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesis-css-python/materials&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1692579254101518&amp;usg=AOvVaw1iwtEUDOpUNqPgdOotb2Br">Introduction to Computational Social Science with Python</a></span><span class="c7 c4">&#39;.

A brief intermission allowed attendees to gather their thoughts before they plunged into the second round of presentations, where teams proudly displayed the culmination of their collaborative efforts and insights.</span></li></ul><h2 class="c2" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c1">Other reflections, challenges, and observations. </span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Reflecting on the SICSS event in Chile, our logistics and facilities primarily catered to the needs of the participants, although we faced certain challenges, especially regarding meals. Our communication efforts, backed by the IMFD communication team, were fruitful, and representation showed diversity in nationality and educational background, even though we observed a concentration of participants from specific demographics.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c3">Logistics:</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;The event undoubtedly thrived due to meticulous logistics planning. A significant advantage was securing a well-equipped room from the university, complete with necessary amenities like WiFi and chargers; the winter break ensured the venue&#39;s uninterrupted availability throughout the event. However, the first week posed a challenge concerning the provision of lunch. Our initial inability to pay for catering meant we had to organize lunches ourselves. This became quite an ordeal, especially ensuring timely delivery while accommodating diverse dietary restrictions. Things became considerably smoother once we transitioned to catering professional services, highlighting the importance of such services for future events.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c3">Communication:</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;For our inaugural event in Chile, the response and interest from students were commendable. The IMFD&#39;s communication team was instrumental in enhancing our outreach. Their efforts to produce and disseminate video capsules across platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter expanded our visibility and probably played a pivotal role in attracting a diverse participant pool.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c3">Representation:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Our endeavor to maintain gender parity was met with varied results. While we ensured a balanced gender representation among participants, achieving the same for speakers and the organizing team proved challenging. An unexpected yet pleasant surprise was the participation of individuals from various educational backgrounds ranging from bachelor students to faculty members and those unaffiliated with Chilean universities or without Chilean nationality. However, a significant portion of the attendees were Chilean, based in the capital, and were amid their Ph.D. pursuits. This indicates the necessity for broader outreach in the future to ensure a more varied representation.</span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c1">Further recommendations</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">From our experiences hosting the event, we have distilled some key lessons and recommendations to aid future organizers. These insights predominantly revolve around two areas: optimizing communication with participants throughout the event and accommodating participants&#39; diverse expertise with the programming language Python.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c3 c16">1. Communication Channels:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_list_4-0 start"><li class="c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Efficiency and Familiarization:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;We utilized a range of platforms, including email, Slack, Google Drive, and our dedicated website. However, we noticed a variance in participants&#39; comfort and proficiency in accessing these platforms. It might benefit future organizers to initiate the event with a brief orientation on navigating these platforms. Furthermore, continually emphasizing the significance and purpose of each platform can encourage more proactive participation. A silver lining, we observed was the collaborative spirit among attendees, with many helping each other access information.</span></li><li class="c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Post-event Access to materials:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;After the event, we consolidated all the resources into an open-access GitHub repository (</span><span class="c11"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ppseguel/sicss-chile-2023/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1692579254105849&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lGbD2N-LeKureAc5VMHWa">https://github.com/ppseguel/sicss-chile-2023/</a></span><span class="c4">). These resources, being in Spanish and Python-centric, supplement areas in which the current SICSS curriculum might be sparse. We kept a Google shared folder for participants with a bit more materials. Yet, for those inspired to adopt a similar approach, obtaining consent from speakers and TAs about sharing materials is essential. Consider that clarity regarding which versions of materials are public and which remain restricted is crucial.</span></li></ul><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c4 c3">2. Catering to Varied Python Expertise:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c4">Interpreting Pre-event Skill Assessment:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Our pre-event survey gauged participants&#39; proficiency with Python and Colab. Yet, the depth of these insights truly manifested during the event. Organizers should perceive such surveys as initial indicators and remain flexible, adjusting the program in response to real-time feedback.</span></li><li class="c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Feedback Loops and Adjustments:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;We adopted an informal approach to gather feedback during the early stages of the event. This helped identify knowledge disparities. For future events, a more structured approach, like simple gestures like raising hands or a quick online poll, can reveal much about participants&#39; comfort levels and understanding.</span></li><li class="c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Emphasizing Onboarding:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The survey results shouldn&#39;t detract from the significance of onboarding materials. As sessions progress, their complexity might catch some off-guard. Organizers can ensure participants are better prepared by highlighting how onboarding materials dovetail into the live sessions.</span></li><li class="c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Flexible Composition of Project Teams:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The composition of project teams should mirror the varied expertise of participants. We focused on topical interest. If it becomes evident that certain members are facing challenges, consider reshuffling groups fast or assist more directly. This promotes a balanced skill set within each team, fostering collaborative learning.</span></li></ul><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c7">To wrap up, our event showcased the vibrancy and potential of collaborative learning. These lessons, drawn from our successes and challenges, highlight the importance of adaptability and resilience. They can serve as valuable insights to make future events even more effective and participant-friendly.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p></body></html>
